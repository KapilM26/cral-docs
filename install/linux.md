# Installing on Linux 

> Before proceeding, make sure you meet the system [requirements](/test).
{.is-info}

## pip 

```
pip3 install cral
```


> CRAL does not define **Tensorflow** and **OpenCV** as dependencies to avoid interfering with builds from source. Please follow this [guide to install Tensorflow (> 2.0)](https://www.tensorflow.org/install). We recommend installing Tensorflow from source for best performance. 
{.is-warning}

> Make sure you follow instructions on [this page](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu) to support GPU. It is highly recommended.
